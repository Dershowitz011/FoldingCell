### Setting up with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate FoldingCell into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Dershowitz011/FoldingCell"
```
